        <h1>About this Project</h1>

        <p><em>Stardew Assistant</em> is a quality-of-life mod for Stardew Valley that improves the gameplay experience without 
            changing the game’s core balance. It includes a nightly diary prompt, smarter shopping tools, and bundle tracking features, 
            all designed to help players make more informed decisions, remember their goals, and reduce repetitive tasks.
            </p>

        <h2>June 12 – Getting Started and Writing Proposal</h2>
        <p>Without a doubt, I did not hit the ground running in this course and had a busy week making up for it. 
            I considered several project ideas, overthought minor details at every opportunity, but did eventually settle on an idea 
            I’m reasonably happy with. Once the hard part was done, I wrote and submitted the project proposal. 
            Open-ended or self-defined projects generally give me analysis paralysis, so committing to an idea and writing 
            the proposal is somewhat of a relief.
            </p>

 

        <p>As for next week, I need to familiarize myself with SMAPI and build/run a small mod as a proof of concept. 
            I think anything modifying the UI directly will be too large of a leap, but I think I could add or alter an event 
            to trigger a part of the game’s existing UI, like the mail delivery, to get my feet wet. In the most technical terms, 
            I could slide into my own DMs with a proof of concept message that confirms the mod can access and respond to game events. 
        </p>
 

        <p>To do so, I’ll need to understand and edit the mail related game events so that some preexisting game event, 
            or a game event I create, sends me mail when it otherwise wouldn’t. I think this will be a good proof of concept, 
            all of my planned QoL improvements will need to be triggered by in-game events. 
        </p>
 

I expect the biggest impediments at this point will be the size of the codebase I’m trying to work with and my unfamiliarity. I also expect some growing pains in setting up the development environment.</p>
